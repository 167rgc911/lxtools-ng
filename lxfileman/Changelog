Thanks go out to Mitch Hamm and Jaime Viehweg for helping debug!

Change history of LXFileman:

0.96b  8/01/1999 Fixed:
		 * Previous versions would crash if they tried to list
		   the contents of a Unix directory that contained a
		   file with curly braces (as created by 'find2perl')

0.96a  3/06/1999 Fixed:
		 * another stupid port/speed problem when double-clicking
		   on file listings (yes, Mitch, finally)

0.96   2/21/1999 Fixed:
		 * Problems setting port/speed when using LX
		   drive letter buttons

		 Added:
		 * Much nicer dialog boxes for deletion confirmation

0.91b 11/9/1997	 Fixed:

		 * Did not restore LX location if LX listing failed

		   filesize by ~ 10%

0.90 10/12/1997  Fixed (?)

		   suggestion of a USENET post by a Sun employee
		   ...should fix Copy/Delete button corruption

		 * Variables & functions renamed for better readability

0.88e 8/10/1997  Fixed:
