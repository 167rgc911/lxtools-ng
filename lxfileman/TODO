To-do list:

Overall:
        (1)     Add support for Ed Falk's "lxbackup" utility
	(2)	Add support for serial device locks to all
		LXTOOLS utils and "lxbackup"
        (3)     Improve the efficiency of the code.
        (4)     File viewer: allow viewing files by copying to
                a temp directory and then launching an appropriate
                viewer. Probably an LXFileman-specific configuration
                file *and* some existing mailcap-type file (Netscape
                configuration?)  -- thoughts, anyone?

Bugs to squash/features to add:

	* Add cancel button to copy dialog box (to cancel remaining copies)
	* Some sort of status window, presumably only for copies
	* Look into copying without single-selecting a file first
	* Try to make the main window resize vertically
	* Try to eliminate Tk errors that pop up when items are clicked
	  too quickly
