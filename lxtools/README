LX TOOLS 1.0a - Access files on the HP palmtops
===============================================

The LX tools are a set of commands that let you transfer files from the Unix
system to your HP palmtop and the other way round via a serial cable. They
also let you create and delete directories. On the palmtop, all you need is
the built-in Filer application. Well, and of course you also need a cable,
a palmtop and a Unix system.

NEW IN VERSION 1.0a:

- environment variables LXTOOLS_LINE and LXTOOLS_BAUD override
  command line options

- 8 serial lines are supported (instead of 4)

- all messages are written to stderr (instead of stdout) so that
  stdin/stdout can be used for data transfer.

- files copied from the LX are now (configurable) in lower case

NEW IN VERSION 1.1:

- little endians / big endians should now work both (untested)

- lxcopy can now recursively enter directories. Using this
  option, you can backup the LX with one command.

- lxcopy can be told to only copy files from the LX that have
  the archive bit set (useful for backups).

- several smaller fixes

NEW IN VERSION 1.1a:

- the serial line setup is no longer done with a "system(stty..." call,
  but replaced by direct procedure calls. This should work on all
  POSIX compliant systems.
  
NEW IN VERSION 1.1b:

The changes for 1.1b were done by Paul Bernard (prb@thinkage.on.ca).
I will attempt to answer questions and provide help with 1.1b but I'm
not officially taking over maintanence of LX Tools at this time
(1999/07).  When I offered these changes to Andreas he told me there
wasn't a master copy and there were many other changes done by others
which I don't have.

- The packet retransmission code has been rewritten.  Previously if an
  error occurred LX Tools would just timeout and abort the transfer.
  Now it will retry the transmission.  This problem would be more
  apparent on high speed connections.

- Added baudrates of 57600 and 115200 for systems that can support such
  speeds directly (Linux it seems, perhaps other modern systems as well.
  I don't know if POSIX now supports higher speeds).

- Fiddled the POSIX version of the serial line configuration so that LX
  Tools will ignore CTS/RTS flow control and carrier detect.  (I don't
  think that that HPLX's filer supports CTS/RTS flow control.)
  
NEW IN VERSION 1.1c (Peter Watkins, peterw@usa.net):

- Re-integrated LXTOOLS_STDOUT changes for LXFileman
  
NEW IN VERSION 1.1d (Peter Watkins, peterw@usa.net):

- 'lxbackup' modified for Year 2000 (years < 80 assumed to be 21st
  century)
- 'lxdir' now displays two-digit years in all cases

VERSION 1.1e (Gerhard Gonter, gonter@ieee.org)

- ports for FreeBSD and AIX

INSTALLATION

- unpack the compressed tar file (you already did that, didn't you ;-)

- check the file "config.h". It should be OK for Linux systems,
  but might need some changes for other systems.

- if you don't have the gcc compiler, you might need to modify
  Makefile

- "make"

- if you want to save some space: "make clean"

- move "lxtools.1" to /usr/local/man/man1 or wherever you keep
  the manual pages
  
- move the executables (lxdir, lxcopy, lxdel, lxmkdir and lxrmdir)
  to where you want to keep them (probably /usr/local/bin)
  
- "man lxtools"

- don't tell me you have done *all* above steps and still need
  further instructions!
