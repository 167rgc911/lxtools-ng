lxbackup is a program to automatically do backups and restores with
an HP 95LX, 100LX or 200LX.

The default is to backup any file on the HP which is newer than its
most recent backup copy (if any).  Optionally, you may backup all files
newer than a specified date, newer than a specified file, or all
files regardless of age.



To do backups:

First, start the hp Filer utility.  If necessary, set the Filer communications
protocol to the values of your choice (e.g. port = com1, buadrate = 38400).

Second, on the Unix box, cd to the directory you want to do the backup
into, and run lxbackup.  Any files in the HP that are newer than
corresponding files in the current directory, or are not found in the
current directory will be backed up (incremental backup.)

    options:

	<dir> <dir>...		directories to back up (C:\)

	-all			all files regardless of age.
	-since <mmddhhmm[yy]>	all files modified since date
	-newer <filename>	all files newer than specified file
	-v			verbose
	-v -v			even more verbose
	-n			not really.  Just show what would be done.
	-1|2|3|4		set com port (1)
	-d <devname>		set full com port name (e.g. /dev/ttya)
	-b <baud>		set baud rate (38400)
	-l			list remote files only
	-restore		restore instead of backup
	-q|h|?			quick help
	-exclude <pat...>	exclude files matching patterns (must be last)

 Return values:
	0 = success
	1 = failure
	2 = user error
	3 = internal error



Examples:

  Note: you should always run lxbackup from a directory set aside for
  backups.

  Backup your C: disk, baud rate defaults to 38400, port defaults to
  first port, directory defaults to C:, backup everything in sight.

	lxbackup

  Backup your C: disk, use 2nd port, set baud rate to 19200.

	lxbackup c: -2 -baud 19200

  Check your C: and A: disks, see which files would be backed up.
  Skip any files ending with .exe, .exm, or .com

	lxbackup c: a: -v -exclude .exe .exm .com

  Backup your C: and A: disks.  Watch progress of backup.
  Skip any files ending with .exe, .exm, or .com

	lxbackup c: a: -v -exclude .exe .exm .com

  Backup some specific directories:

	lxbackup c:/_dat c:/games c:/pgp -v -exclude .exe .com

  Here is the shell script I use on my unix box to execute my
  daily backups.  Executables (.exm, .exe, .com) are not backed up in
  order to save space.

	#! /bin/sh

	cd $HOME/hp100/backups
	lxbackup c: a: -v -d /dev/ttyb -exclude .exm .exe .com

    (This creates the subdirectories $HOME/hp100/backups/c:/ and
    $HOME/hp100/backups/a:/)



  Restore everything from your C: disk.  Baud rate defaults to 38400, port
  defaults to first port.  All files which are older on the HP or are
  completely missing are restored.

	lxbackup -restore

  Restore one specific directory:

	lxbackup c:/games -2 -baud 19200

  Restore all files which have been modified on local disk more recently
  than the file "lastbackup.list"

	lxbackup c: -v -restore -newer lastbackup.list



Notes:

	Upper case and lower case do not matter.  Lxbackup will convert
	all filenames to upper case for the HP, and lower case for the
	local file systems.

	Likewise, it does not matter if you use '/' or '\' as the
	directory seperator.

	It is not required to put the drive letter in the directory
	name, but highly recommended.  Whichever you do, be consistent,
	as this is the name lxbackup will use for the directory into
	which the files will be stored.  If you use a drive letter, the
	backups will be done into a directory with that drive letter as
	a name, e.g. "c:/".  (Unix allows ':' (and practically anything
	else) as part of a directory or file name)

	Order of directories and options is unimportant, except that
	the -exclude option must be the last thing on the command
	line.
